# A Machine Learning Model for Earlier Prediction of Cardiovascular Disease
Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is a major global health issue and one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Predicting CVD risk accurately is crucial for healthcare professionals to make well-informed decisions about patient care. Machine learning models have emerged as valuable tools in healthcare diagnostics, offering a promising avenue for predicting CVD risk.

This repository presents a comprehensive study focused on developing effective prediction models for CVD risk. Our primary aim is to create a robust dataset that enhances prediction model accuracy by combining data from various sources. We address missing data using innovative techniques, ensuring the dataset's integrity and improving the reliability of our predictive models.

# project overview

The primary goals of this project include:
1. **Hybrid Dataset Creation:** We combine datasets from different regions, including Hungary, Switzerland, Cleveland, and Long Beach, that are commonly used in heart disease prediction. These datasets often contain missing values, which can significantly affect the performance of prediction models. Our focus is on creating a hybrid dataset that includes the collective attributes from these sources.

2.  **Missing Value Imputation:** We address the issue of missing values by applying distinct imputation techniques, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Mean, Mode, and Median imputation. This process helps us generate a new dataset named the "Sathvi" dataset. The resultant dataset contains 920 instances and 14 attributes, ensuring that there are no null values.

3. **Normalization:** To ensure consistency and enhance model performance, we apply normalization to the dataset. Specifically, we utilize the StandardScaler technique to scale column values to a certain range, typically with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This process helps prevent features with larger scales from dominating the learning process and ensures that each feature contributes equally to the model's predictions.

4. **Predictive Analysis:** Leveraging the unified and normalized dataset, we explore a range of machine learning algorithms including k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and CatBoost for predictive modeling. Our objective is to develop accurate models to assess cardiovascular disease risk.
